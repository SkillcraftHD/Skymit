# Skymit
Skymit is a free 2D arcade-like game where you control an alien dodging obstacles to reach the moon
## Why?
Since I believe that game development should be as transparent as possible. I'm making every game open source, meaning you can read, copy, and use the code for your own purposes. This can both help people understand how I made the game and maybe learn something from my code, as well as use the code for their own projects in order to speed up their development.
