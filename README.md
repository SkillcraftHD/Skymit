## About the game
Skymit is a free 2D arcade-like game where you control an alien dodging obstacles to reach the moon.
## Discord Server
If want, you can join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/MQgTSM4qtm) to stay up to date and contribute to new ideas and features for the future of the game.
## Why Open Source?
Since I believe that development should be as transparent as possible, I'm making every project's code open source, meaning you can read, copy, and use the code for your own purposes. This can both help people understand how I made the projects and maybe learn something from my code, as well as use the code for their own projects in order to speed up their development. However, don't forget that the code is still under the MIT license, more info in the [LICENSE file](LICENSE].
